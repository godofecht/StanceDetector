# RoBERTa-Based Stance Detection

This repository contains the implementation of a stance detection model based on RoBERTa, an advanced extension of the BERT model. The work is grounded in the research presented in the paper ["Stance Prediction with RoBERTa"](https://aclanthology.org/2020.nlp4if-1.3.pdf), authored by Anushka Shankar under the supervision of Dr. Harish Tayyar.

## Overview

Stance detection involves identifying the position or stance expressed by a user towards a particular topic or issue, especially on social media platforms like Twitter and Reddit. This repository leverages the RoBERTa model, which builds on the robust capabilities of BERT by improving the training methodology and utilizing a larger dataset for better contextual understanding.

## Key Features

- **RoBERTa Model Integration:** Enhanced version of BERT, pre-trained on a larger corpus with more robust fine-tuning capabilities.
- **Stance Classification:** Identifies whether a text expresses support, opposition, or neutrality towards a given topic.
- **Cross-Platform Application:** Suitable for analyzing stance on multiple social media platforms, including Twitter and Reddit.
- **Customizable:** Easily adaptable for various domains and languages with additional fine-tuning.
- **Preprocessing Pipeline:** Includes text preprocessing steps such as tokenization, stop-word removal, and normalization, tailored for social media text.

## Applications

- **Social Media Analysis:** Identify public opinion on trending topics, political issues, and social movements by analyzing stance on platforms like Twitter and Reddit.
- **Brand Monitoring:** Understand customer sentiment and stance towards products or services.
- **Political Sentiment Analysis:** Gauge voter sentiment and stance towards candidates or policies.
- **Misinformation Detection:** Detect stance to identify potential sources of misinformation or polarized content.
